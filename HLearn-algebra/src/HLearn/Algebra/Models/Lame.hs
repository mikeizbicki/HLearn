-- | Lame trainers are trainers that are crippled---They are not Monoids, and training their models is not a homomorphism.  This means we can't do any of the cool manipulations automatically that we can do with the HomTrainer class.  These classes are provided mostly for development and testing purposes.  It is not recommended that you use any of their instances.
