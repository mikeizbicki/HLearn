3. Past Usage:

	Chess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame
   databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated
   elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored
   denote whether or not positions are won for either side, or include also
   the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the
   point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide
   not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft, 1986) for
   testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from, say,
   a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the
   following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required
   game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would
   be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single
   iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson, 1986).

   A KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was
   described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It
   should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct, but the class
   distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the
   task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a
   fixed number of moves, assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was
   structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw, zero,
   one, ..., sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are
   used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and
   correct solution for this task.

   	The typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest
   that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.


4. Relevant Information:
   An Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) or relational learning framework is
   assumed (Muggleton, 1992). The learning system is provided with examples
   of chess positions described only by the coordinates of the pieces on the
   board. Background knowledge in the form of row and column differences is
   also supplied. The relations necessary to form a correct and concise
   classifier for the target concept must be discovered by the learning system
   (the examples already provide a complete extensional definition).
   The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to
   classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions
   as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example
   positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that
   additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via
   hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain.
