    The BILIRUBIN attribute appears to be continuously-valued.  I checked
    this with the donater, Bojan Cestnik, who replied:

      About the hepatitis database and BILIRUBIN problem I would like to say
      the following: BILIRUBIN is continuous attribute (= the number of it's
      "values" in the ASDOHEPA.DAT file is negative!!!); "values" are quoted
      because when speaking about the continuous attribute there is no such 
      thing as all possible values. However, they represent so called
      "boundary" values; according to these "boundary" values the attribute
      can be discretized. At the same time, because of the continious
      attribute, one can perform some other test since the continuous
      information is preserved. I hope that these lines have at least roughly 
      answered your question.
